# seat buddy
A quick website for finding who you will be sitting next to at grad 
*disclaimer: this is just sorting through all 21s. So anyone graduating early or late as well as 3/2s may not be on this list.* 
This is because the dartmouth api wouldnt let me search by grad term without special permissions, which i was not about to go get.
